Environmental Impacts of Food Consumption

Analysis of the environmental impacts caused by food consumption, using representative data for the French general population. 

This repository provides the main scripts and data tables used in the Food Env. Impacts project. The main objective of this project was to estimate the environmental impacts caused by the diets of the French population. In particular, the objective was to compare the impacts of men and women. 

Full information on the project is available at: http://dismalscience.eu

This repository provides the following files:

Raw data from AGRIBALYSE (environmental impacts data)
Matching tables between the two sources
Summary of impacts
Impacts at the level of individual persons
R scripts to derive graphs and other analyses, as well as the web app to estimate your impacts

Some files are too big to be uploaded on github (e.g., ANSES data or matching of impacts at the level of individuals). They are available upon request.
